Scripts:
=====

**Makefile**: this script compiles `*.tex` files to pdf using LaTeX and BibTeX, and then cleans up temporary files generated in the process. The GNU Makefile tool is required to install in the system. The line-ending has to be LF per the requirement of GNU standard. Of course, the LaTeX compilers have to be in the PATH. Usage example: see [NanofiberPaper](https://github.com/CQuIC/FaradaySqueezingProtocol).
