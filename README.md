This repo stores scripts for me to automate some of my daily computer tasks.
These include compiling a LaTeX file and cleaning up temporary files, synchronizing Git branches in accordance with any changes in the master branch and so on.
The `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files in this repo are actually widely used in my other projects.

If you find these scripts useful, feel free to use.
I appreciate if any improvements or suggestions can be merged back to this repo in a Pull Request.

Thanks,

Xiaodong Qi
